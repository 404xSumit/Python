how to make variables rules for variables and type convention of
variables

sher = "Sumit"      #This is how we write this is an normal way of writing

# 3 way you should not wtite variables

# 1. Starting with and in between space EX:-

 quite="life"   # this creates error as this is having an space in front of the variable 
Sumit singh= "Great person"         # this creates an error as this is having space in between
sumit="Name"    #This does not create any error as this is something how we should write the varibale
sumit ="Name"       #After writing the variable name you can add space the python doesnt count it 

#2. Numbers cannot be added in front of variable 

1sher = "Sumit"     #Only here is the problem as we cannot write the number first then the variable name 
she1r ="Sumit"      #we can add number in between 
sher1 = "Sumit"     #we can add number in the end


#3. We cannot use any special charater in our variable name 

@sher = "Sumit" #In the given way we cannot use this like special character we cannot use anywhere in the given varibale name
$sher = "Sumit" #In the given way we cannot use this like special character we cannot use anywhere in the given varibale name
%sher ="sumit"  #In the given way we cannot use this like special character we cannot use anywhere in the given varibale name
sh@r = "Sumit"  #In the given way we cannot use this like special character we cannot use anywhere in the given varibale name
singh$ ="thakur"#In the given way we cannot use this like special character we cannot use anywhere in the given varibale name


sumit_singh = "name"    #Only this special Symbol can be used but also this cannot be used in front


"""
There are three naming conventions they are :- 
1.Camel Case 
2.Pascal case
3.Snake case
