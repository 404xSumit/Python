# Loop :-  When we have to do a work multiple time or continiously we don not have to repeat the task again and again it is so annoying and make the task longer and time consuming and that is why they introduced the loop to repeat the task until and unless the condition is satisified 
# Python mainly consist of 2 loop that are :-
# 1. For loop   -> This loop is used when we know the end point like from which point the loop is starting and ending 
# 2. While loop -> This loop does not need an end point it run untill and unless the loop meets the required condition 

# for i in range (1,20,2):
#     print(i)

# for i in range (1,20+1,2):
#     print(i)

# n = int(input("Enter the number:- "))
# for i in range (1,n+1):
#     print(i)

# Printing table of 5

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i*5)

#printing table form taking the user input

# n = int(input("Enter the number:- "))
# for i in range (1,11):
#     print(i*n)
